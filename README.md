### About This Service
This is a standard GitHub repository; it is being used to house application properties from all services in the `Bootiful Microservices` series.

The files are organized in different sub-directories under the `/services` root directory. When a new service is created, a new sub-directory must also be created to house the new service's property files.

The naming of the files must follow the convention of `[application name].yml` or `[application name].properties` in order to enable the [`Config-Service`](https://github.com/Prempeh-Gyan/1.0-Config-Service) to locate property files effectively.
